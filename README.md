## Motion-Tracking-Synthesizer-in-MAX-MSP

#### In this project, there are four different screens that each have a different modulation. These four screens track the motion of the user by computer camera, and the motions are transformed to the value for the modulations. these modulations are applied immediately while the sounds from samples are played.
