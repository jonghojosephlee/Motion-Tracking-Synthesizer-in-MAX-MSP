# Motion-Tracking-Modulation-in-MAX/MSP
(MAX/MSP language is based on C/C++)


ABOUT

#### In this project, there are four different screens that each have a different modulation. 
#### These four screens track the motion of the user by computer camera, and the motions are transformed to the value for the modulations. 
#### These modulations are applied immediately while the sounds from samples are played.


#### There are four bars that the user can put his/her own samples to try the modulation
